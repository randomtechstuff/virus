Overview
This repository contains a batch script designed to allow users to terminate individual applications running on a Windows operating system. It is intended for educational purposes and as a demonstration of batch scripting capabilities.

Description
The Application Termination Script provides a user-friendly interface for managing running processes. Users can select from a predefined list of common applications to terminate, such as browsers, office applications, media players, and system utilities. The script promotes responsible usage by requiring user confirmation before killing any process, thereby minimizing the risk of accidental data loss.

Features
Interactive Command-Line Interface: Users can view and select applications to terminate directly from the command prompt.
Common Applications List: The script includes a comprehensive list of frequently used applications, making it easy for users to identify and terminate them.
Confirmation Prompt: Before terminating any application, the script prompts users for confirmation, ensuring that they are aware of the consequences of their actions.
Important Notes
Data Loss Risk: Forcefully terminating applications may lead to unsaved work being lost. Users are advised to save their work before executing the script.
Administrative Privileges: Some applications may require elevated permissions to be terminated. The script may need to be run as an administrator for full functionality.
Use in Safe Environments: It is recommended to run this script in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine, to prevent unintended disruptions on critical systems.
Usage
